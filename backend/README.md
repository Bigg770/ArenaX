## Backup & Recovery Objectives

PostgreSQL is the single source of truth for financial, match, session, and wallet state (see the Redis policy below). Backups therefore cover **PostgreSQL plus the required metadata and secrets** needed to bring the service back: database credentials, JWT signing keys, Stellar signing keys, and payment provider keys.

### Recovery objectives

| Data set | RPO (max data loss) | RTO (max downtime) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL (all schemas) | **15 minutes** (continuous WAL archiving + 15-min base backups) | **60 minutes** |
| Required metadata (migrations, config) | 0 (versioned in git) | 15 minutes |
| Required secrets (JWT, Stellar, payment keys) | 0 (stored in the secrets manager with versioning) | 15 minutes |

These objectives are the contract the backup and restore-drill procedures below are measured against. A drill that misses either objective is a failed drill and must be fixed before the next release.

### Backup workflow

- **Encrypted at rest:** every PostgreSQL dump and WAL segment is encrypted with `age` (or `gpg`) using a public recipient key before leaving the host. Plaintext backups are never written to shared storage.
- **Access-limited:** backups are written to a dedicated bucket/prefix with least-privilege IAM — the backup writer can only `PutObject`, and only the restore role can `GetObject`. Bucket versioning and object lock are enabled so backups cannot be silently deleted or overwritten.
- **Retention:** 35 days of daily base backups plus 7 days of WAL, matching the RPO above. Retention is enforced by lifecycle policy, not by the backup job.
- **Independently verified:** a separate verification job (not the backup job) downloads each new backup, recomputes its SHA-256 checksum, compares it against the checksum recorded at creation time, and performs a `pg_restore --list` / `pg_verifybackup` integrity check. Verification failures page on-call and mark the backup as untrusted.

### Restore-drill procedure

Run this drill at least monthly and before any release that changes the schema. Retain the resulting report.

1. **Provision an isolated staging target.** Use a throwaway database instance and a separate secrets scope; never restore over production.
2. **Restore PostgreSQL.** Fetch the latest verified base backup and the WAL needed to reach the target point in time, decrypt, and restore. Record the wall-clock start and end.
3. **Restore metadata and secrets.** Apply migrations to the restored database and load the required secrets into the staging scope from the secrets manager.
4. **Verify integrity.** Confirm the restored database passes `pg_verifybackup`/checksum validation and that row counts for critical tables (`wallets`, `transactions`, `matches`, `tournaments`, `sessions`) match the source snapshot.
5. **Validate the application.** Start the backend against the restored database and secrets, then check `GET /health` and `GET /ready`, run the smoke test suite, and confirm a representative read (leaderboard) and a representative write (a test match result) succeed.
6. **Measure against objectives.** Record the measured RTO (time from drill start to a passing application validation) and the measured data loss (difference between the source's latest committed transaction and the restored point). Both must be within the objectives table above.
7. **Safe traffic cutover (production only).** If this drill is being used for an actual recovery: put the service in maintenance mode, drain in-flight requests, point the application at the restored database, verify `/ready`, then shift traffic gradually (canary → full) while watching error rates. Roll back by repointing to the previous database if validation fails.
8. **Retain the report.** Store the drill report (date, operator, measured RTO, measured data loss, pass/fail, and any remediation) alongside the backup records.

## Redis Failure Semantics & Recovery Policy

Redis is used for **derived, rebuildable state only**. PostgreSQL (and the Stellar ledger for on-chain effects) is the single source of truth for all financial, match, session, and wallet state. No authoritative state may exist only in Redis.

### Redis usage inventory

| Redis-backed operation | Classification | Durable backing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Leaderboard / ranking sorted sets | Cache (derived) | `matches`, `tournaments`, reputation rows in Postgres |
| Matchmaking queue | Ephemeral coordination | Match records in Postgres; queue is re-derivable from open matches |
| Pub/Sub event fan-out (match/session/wallet events) | Transport (at-most-once) | Event rows in Postgres; consumers reconcile from durable records |
| Session / auth token cache | Cache (derived) | `sessions` table in Postgres; JWT is authoritative |
| Wallet balance / payout cache | Cache (derived) | `wallets`, `transactions` tables + Stellar ledger |
| Rate-limit counters | Ephemeral | None required; loss only loosens limits temporarily |

**Invariant:** financial and final match state are always committed to Postgres (and, where applicable, confirmed on-chain) *before* any Redis write. Redis is never the commit point.

### Degraded behavior per operation

- **Leaderboard reads/writes:** on Redis error, serve rankings computed directly from Postgres (slower path). Writes are best-effort; a failed write is logged and the entry is rebuilt on next read. No duplicate scoring — scores are recomputed from durable match results, not incremented blindly.
- **Matchmaking queue:** if Redis is unavailable, new matchmaking requests are rejected with `503` and a `Retry-After` header rather than silently queued in memory (avoids split-brain duplicate matches). Existing matches continue from Postgres.
- **Pub/Sub:** publishers treat delivery as best-effort; on publish failure the event is already persisted in Postgres and consumers pick it up via the durable event log. Consumers are idempotent (keyed by event id) so replays never create duplicate work.
- **Session cache:** cache miss or Redis outage falls back to validating against the `sessions` table. Auth never fails open.
- **Wallet cache:** reads fall back to Postgres/Stellar; writes go to Postgres first and invalidate the cache. A stale cache is never trusted for balance checks.
- **Rate limiting:** on Redis outage, fall back to a conservative in-process limiter; counters reset on recovery.

### Recovery policy

After a Redis restart or partial connectivity:

1. **Reconnect** with bounded exponential backoff; the process stays up and serves degraded paths meanwhile.
2. **Rebuild derived state** from durable records: leaderboards are recomputed from Postgres match results, session and wallet caches are lazily repopulated on read, and the matchmaking queue is reconstructed from open matches.
3. **Replay** any Pub/Sub events missed during the outage by draining the durable event log; consumers dedupe by event id so replay is idempotent.
4. **No data loss for authoritative state** — because it was never only in Redis, recovery never needs to reconstruct financial or final match state from the cache.

### Health & readiness signals

- `GET /health` reports process liveness.
- `GET /ready` reports readiness and includes a `redis` component status (`ok` / `degraded` / `down`). Redis being `degraded` does **not** fail readiness for operations that have a durable fallback; it is surfaced so operators can act. Operations with no safe fallback (matchmaking enqueue) return `503` while Redis is down.

### Validation

Integration tests exercise Redis restart, timeout, and partial-connectivity scenarios to confirm: no authoritative state is lost, degraded paths behave as documented, and recovery rebuilds derived state without duplicate work.

## Setup & Development

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (`cargo`, `rustup`) - latest stable version
- PostgreSQL (v15+) with sharding support
- Redis (v7+) with Pub/Sub enabled
- `sqlx-cli` (v0.8.6)
- MinIO (or AWS S3) for file storage
- Docker and Docker Compose for local development
- Stellar CLI and SDK for blockchain integration
- Node.js (v18+) for testing scripts

### Build & CI Prerequisites
Building all targets and running tests requires reachable PostgreSQL and Redis instances, as SQLx query macros perform compile-time SQL verification against the migrated schema:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string to migrated PostgreSQL database (e.g. `postgres://arenax:arenax@localhost:5432/arenax_ci`).
- `REDIS_URL`: Connection string to Redis server (e.g. `redis://localhost:6379`).

CI runs without `continue-on-error` on `backend-build`, strictly enforcing that compiler checks, type validation, and tests pass against live services.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arenax/arenax.git
cd backend

# Install Rust dependencies
cargo build

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run database migrations
./scripts/migrate.sh

# Start the backend server
cargo run

# Or run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Development & CI Commands

```bash
# Type check all targets (lib, bin, tests, examples) against migrated database
cargo check --all-targets --locked

# Run tests against live database and Redis
cargo test --all-targets --locked

# Run tests with coverage
cargo test --coverage

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test integration

# Run specific test module
cargo test auth::tests

# Check code formatting
cargo fmt

./test_ci_locally.sh

# Database operations
sqlx migrate add -r <migration_name>
./scripts/verify-migrations.sh
./scripts/migrate.sh
./scripts/migration-status.sh
./scripts/backup-database.sh
./scripts/rollback-last-migration.sh

# Stellar integration testing
./scripts/test_stellar.sh
```

### SQLx Offline Compilation & Query Metadata Workflow

ArenaX supports SQLx offline mode so developers and CI can build the backend targets without needing a live, persistent PostgreSQL database.

#### 1. Building in Offline Mode
To compile the backend without connecting to a database:
```bash
# Enable offline mode using the committed .sqlx query metadata
SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo check --all-targets --locked
```

#### 2. Generating & Updating Query Metadata
Whenever you write new queries, edit existing `sqlx::query!` / `sqlx::query_as!` macros, or add/alter database migrations:
1. Ensure your local PostgreSQL service is running and migrations are applied:
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL="postgres://arenax:arenax@localhost:5432/arenax_ci"
   ./scripts/migrate.sh
   ```
2. Generate reproducible query metadata across all targets:
   ```bash
   cargo sqlx prepare -- --all-targets
   ```
3. Commit the updated query metadata files in the `.sqlx/` directory to version control.

#### 3. CI Detection of Stale or Missing Metadata
CI validates that committed query metadata exactly matches the real migration schema:
```bash
cargo sqlx prepare --check -- --all-targets
```
If a query macro has changed without updating `.sqlx/`, or if metadata is missing, this check will fail CI with actionable errors identifying the out-of-sync queries.

#### 4. When Online Database Validation is Still Required
- **Schema & Query Changes**: Modifying table definitions, adding migrations, or writing new SQL queries **must** be validated against a live database using `cargo sqlx prepare -- --all-targets` or online `cargo check`. Offline mode only replays previously validated query signatures.
- **Runtime Testing**: Running integration tests (`cargo test`) that execute database transactions requires a real PostgreSQL database instance.

`BACKEND_MIGRATION_MODE` defaults to `run`, which applies and validates SQLx migrations during backend startup. Use `disabled` only when migrations are applied by a separate deployment step. See [MIGRATIONS.md](MIGRATIONS.md) for the full migration workflow, rollback process, and CI expectations.

## Code Organization & Architecture

### Module Structure
The backend follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **`api_error.rs`**: Centralized error handling with custom error types and HTTP status mapping
- **`config.rs`**: Environment configuration management with validation and defaults
- **`db.rs`**: Database connection pooling, transaction management, and connection health checks
- **`lib.rs`**: Public API exports and library initialization
- **`main.rs`**: Application entry point, server startup, and graceful shutdown
- **`middleware.rs`**: Custom middleware for authentication, logging, CORS, and rate limiting
- **`telemetry.rs`**: Structured logging, tracing, metrics collection, and observability setup

### Service Layer Pattern
Each service follows a consistent pattern:
- **HTTP Handlers** (`http/`): Request/response handling, input validation, and error mapping
- **Service Layer** (`service/`): Business logic, data transformation, and external service integration
- **Database Models**: Data access layer with SQLx for type-safe database operations

### Error Handling Strategy
